Potential extensions of the AscII editor

Mar 9

1) We should make a box selector,
2) copy and paste, 
3) download as txt,
4) download as html,
5) vertical typing,
6) ascII paint brush,
7) Loading a TXT file as a canvas
8) The ability to interpolate other canvases over each other.
9) Special characters selector box/selector boxes in general.
 Kind of like a color picker for characters.
10) Using this ability to interpolate canvases and upload TXT files, 
we should make a small library of stock txt "images" and "shapes", 
just like all sorts of editors tend to have :)
Of course, another thing to do is figure out 
	a) how to use OpenCV to load images, 
	b) how to resize them,
	c) to make an ability to turn one into an AscII Canvas.
