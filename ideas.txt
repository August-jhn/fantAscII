Potential extensions of the AscII editor

Mar 9 - Jimmy: I think the best way to implement this is a toolbar style format
		Jimmy cont: We can use the filled area at the top to put the name of fantaskii

1) We should make a box selector,
2) copy and paste, 
3) download as txt,
4) download as html,
5) vertical typing,
6) ascII paint brush,
7) Loading a TXT file as a canvas
8) The ability to interpolate other canvases over each other.
9) Special characters selector box/selector boxes in general.
 Kind of like a color picker for characters.
10) Using this ability to interpolate canvases and upload TXT files, 
we should make a small library of stock txt "images" and "shapes", 
just like all sorts of editors tend to have :)
Of course, another thing to do is figure out 
	a) how to use OpenCV to load images, 
	b) how to resize them,
	c) to make an ability to turn one into an AscII Canvas.
11) Use Enter to pop back down to the original spot where the typing started, make arrow keys do similar in typing mode. 
12) Copy and paste of text boxes as well, maybe we could even find a way of interpolating the clip board onto the askii canvas.
13) Make history with crtZ
14) Possibly make a seperate Editor class, which inherits from Canvas
15) Hold down key while using arrow keys to draw with the arrow keys
16) Save canvas into canvas file

Jimmy (simple easr of use ideas):
1) Backspace should delete a character
2) Outline showing edges of canvas
