Something interesting was that Ben noticed the page is very slow and resource intensive every time he reloads.

I believe I know why, and may have actually solved the issue.

The solution was to use the old method of completely re-renduring the entire <p> tag every time we change something for static stuff.

While this is obviously much slower for things like animations and real-time editing, it's actually pretty resource intensive when
it comes to loading the page. This would make sense, as this is where Chrome was having trouble on Ben's computer.
